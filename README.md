# What Is EmptineX | Who are EmptineX‚ùì
- We are a Organization thatt is created to make empty repositories's With some purposes behind them, Mostly in codings and others ETC.

# What do we do‚ùì
- We make repositories that are Empty except A File left behind with empty text inside. As EmptineX Refers to Emptiness Itself we only make Empty repositories with only 1 file inside. Mostly they are considered Templates or so.


# Uses of repositoriesüì•
- We could make a simple repository with nothing inside it, right? Well theres a reason for not making it a repository but making it a organisation. The creator of EmptineX have a wierd username which him cant even change because risky for his repositories certified within the username. So thought making a whole organization to fill all the needed Empty templates.

- We make Total Empty repositories
- We make empty code repositories
- We make repositories Name very simple.

- 3rd one  is what most people love and want.
